## How to
You can use the app directly from [Google Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pagedigest/maalbmdhcneklfnppmlbhileahnmflpa),
or you can build it from sources.
### How to build
- `npm i && npm run build`
- include it by going to chrome://extensions
- enable developer mode
- load unpacked from `dist` directory.

## Motivation
I wanted to try out creating my first Chrome extension and needed a simple SEO utility.
Turns out there are not many utilities out there that count text to html ratio.
I calculate text to html ratio as `textContent/bodyInnerHtml`.
I don't think text content should include a `style` or a `script` tag.
There may be some differences in metrics compared to other apps,
due to different content scopes and formulas.
